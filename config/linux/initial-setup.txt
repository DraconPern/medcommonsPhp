Initial Setup for ev1servers
============================

Root Password
-------------
Change the root password to something amazingly random.  All admin
access should be through 'sudo' -- no real need for logging in as
root::

    # passwd
    ...

Users
-----
Before we start adding users, a couple of things need to be done.

We're using Maildir for incoming mail.  So add the following
directories to '/etc/skel' so new users automatically get the right
directories created::

    # mkdir /etc/skel/Maildir
    # mkdir /etc/skel/Maildir/cur
    # mkdir /etc/skel/Maildir/new
    # mkdir /etc/skel/Maildir/tmp

And change the permissions::
    # chmod -R 700 /etc/skel/Maildir

Note that 'ev1servers.net' made the mistake of adding the 'pegasus'
group with the same group ID as 'admin', so group IDs are off by one.
I think this is dangerous, so either delete the 'pegasus' user/group
before adding users, or change the pegasus group ID back to 100::

    # vi /etc/group
    ; change pegasus:x:500:
    ;     to pegasus:x:100

    # vi /etc/passwd
    ; change pegasus:x:100:500:...
    ;     to pegasus:x:100:100:...

Add users for all the technical people.  The style is just to use
first names::

    # /usr/sbin/useradd -c "Terence Way" -m -G wheel terry
    # /usr/sbin/useradd -c "Bill Donner" -m -G wheel bill
    # /usr/sbin/useradd -c "Sean Doyle" -m -G wheel sean
    # /usr/sbin/useradd -c "Simon Sadedin" -m -G wheel simon
    # /usr/sbin/useradd -c "Keith Alan Rodwell" -m -G wheel keith

Be sure to change passwords on these accounts.

The options are '-c "Full Name"' to set the comment field in
/etc/passwd, '-m' to make a directory, and '-G' to enable the user in
the 'wheel' system administrators group.

We can now enable 'wheel' in the sudoers file::

    # /usr/sbin/visudo

And uncomment the line::

    # %wheel   ALL=(ALL)	ALL

So it looks like:

    %wheel    ALL=(ALL)	ALL

Login Services
==============
We should not allow unencrypted access.  This means disabling telnet.  If
the file /etc/xinetd.d/telnet exists, edit it::

    # vi /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
    ; change disable = no
    ;     to disable = yes

    # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/xinetd.pid`

Note that those are backquotes ` and not regular quotes '

We should not allow root to login using ssh::

    # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ; Uncomment #PermitRootLogin yes
    ;  change to PermitRootLogin no

    # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`

Test out the setup.  We should not be able to log in as 'root' using
ssh, we should not be able to log in at ALL with telnet::

    $ telnet 67.15.178.38
    ...connection refused...

    $ ssh root@67.15.178.38
    ...despite our best attempts, we can't get in...

    $ ssh terry@67.15.178.38
    ...works...
    [terry@plain ~] sudo su
    Password: ...

    [root@plain ~]# 

When everything has been tested to our satisfaction, we delete the
ev1servers' provided 'admin' account::

    # /usr/sbin/userdel admin
