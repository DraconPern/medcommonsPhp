<h3>MedCommons Group Requirements</h3>
This is a discussion document prior to finalizing the design. My goal is to have this code done and running by the weekend.
<h4>A MedCommons Group Is Distinguished by Type</h4>
The types of interest right now include (PRACTICE, SIG). A Practice Group binds healthcare providers together under a common
data sharing and accounting infrastructure. A Sig - Special Interest Group binds like minded individuals according to some special
interest, and may include access to special content or tools, etc. Any number of types of groups can be established. For now
the types of group is completely controlled by MedCommons. 
<p>There has been some discussion about whether patients are somehow involved in a practice group. I think that we 
can imagine another group type, a PRACTICEPATIENT group, if we really have to, and deal witgh all of that later</p>
<h4>Each Type of Group Has Its Own Special Additional Needs</h4>
For example, a Practice Group specifies its RLS. a Special Interest Group might have a set of bookmarks to share, and a 3rd party
vendor like CINA might set up a group as a means of offering content, components or service extensions to its members.
<h4>A MedCommons Group Has Members</h4>
These members are represented by their identities, whether provided by MedCommons or not. 
But each member has a medcommons id which implicitly points to the member's account record on MedCommons
<h4>A MedCommons Group Has Administrators</h4>
An administrator can add, remove, and delete members of a group. Depending on configuration settings, a group administrator
can also create beneficial identities (accounts) on MedCommons. 
There can be multiple administrators of a group, all with equal access to the group administration functions.
The administrators of a group may or may not be members of the group.
<h3>How Groups and Accounts Are Related</h3>
<h4>MedCommons Accounts Maintain Identity</h4>
There is no particular requirement that a MedCommons Account represent an individual, but typically they represent
patients, doctors, and administrators who have either created accounts directly on MedCommons or via a Liberty like 
identity provider, or via Microsoft InfoCard.
<p>In fact, it is useful to set up a distinguished account for every group, so that the group itself can maintain a billing identity,etc.
</p>
<h4>MedCommons Accounts Maintain Account Balances and Billing Info</h4>
These are accounts, and hence it is sensible to view them as the entities of interest for billing. So, for example, if a Practice Group
wants to assume the charges for the patients for which it is creating beneficial accounts, can be easily accommodated.
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
The implementaion is completely generic with one singular set of tables and one webservice for all of MedCommons.
<h4>Tables Maintained to Support Groups</h4>
<ul>
<li>Group Type Table - one row for each type of (PRACTICE, SIG, etc) - maintained by MedCommons</li>
<li>Group Instance Table - one row for each practice, sig, enrolled on MedCommons</li>
<li>Group Properties Table - one row for each property associated with any group instance</li>
<li>Group Member Table - maps MedCommons IDs into Group Instances</li>
<li>Group Administrator Table - maps MedCommons IDs into Group Instances</li>
</ul>
<h4>Defining a New Group Instance</h4>
The process for defining a new Group requires the preparation of an bilaterally signed XML Contract Specification between MedCommons and 
the Group getting set up (eg Jaroka, or HughTaylor Associates). This contract identifies any charging or revenue sharing
strucutres, and specifies one or more MedCommons IDs of users who can administer this group. (More can be added lagter)
<h4>Admin UI</h4>
A small set of screens allows maintance of the tables. Presumably, they will be specialized to accommodate a Practice Admin
(who wants to talk about Providers) versus a SIG Admin (who wants to talk about Members), etc.
<p>Adding a new group type is a manual process for now</p>
