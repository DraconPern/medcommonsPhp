ehgt Customizations
by
bill donnerCHANGES TO CONSOLE /CUSTOMIZE DIRECTORY
A bunch of changes were made to the standard appliance templates in order to meet the requirements of EHGT. These changes are checked into the standard /trunk/php tree under /_ehgt
BASE.HTML
was altered to add ehgt’s direct contact page on their website, and to remove the sitemap link, which is also broken in the generic template anyway
INDEX.HTML
stripped to almost nothing but a login box, as per ehgt specification - currently this still goes to the actual /acct/login.php page, but we might move the password box from there onto index.html to completely eliminate that
LOGIN.INC
was altered despite the warnings, in order to say “Email or Account ID” as per ehgt specs
LOGIN.TPL.PHP
was altered to say “Email or Account ID”
ROOT.HTML
was altered to make the small info> link on top point to an ehgt page
a new div to be shown instead of the stamp in the upper right hand corner was introduced as “invisi” instead of the normal “visi” id
the small bit of javascript that actually makes “visi” visible was altered in order to make “invisi” visible in the case only when there is no “MC” cookie
STYLE.CSS
was altered to support the “invisi” id

Export the subversion php/_ehgt directory, zip it, scp it to the target machine, then unzip it at the target.

WHAT TO DO AFTER AN APPLIANCE UPGRADE
0) su to root on target appliance (in this case - ehgt.myhealthespace.com)
1) Copy all the files from _ehtg/customize to /var/www/console/customize on the target appliance
2) Copy /trunk/php/_ehgt/customize/images/* to /var/www/console/templates/www/images
3) Copy /trunk/php/_ehgt/index.html to /var/www/console/templates/www/index.html 
   (Note: must edit index.html to refer to 'ehgt2' instead of 'ehgt') (Or whatever the real machine's hostname is - there is now more than one ehgt machine).
4) Copy /trunk/php/_ehgt/templates/www/* to /var/www/console/templates/www
5) Copy _ehgt/templates/tu.html to /var/www/console/templates/
6) Go to /var/www/console/bin/; enter ./mc-permissions to set permissions so that the console can read 
   new files.
7) Log into appliance's console https://ehgt.myhealthespace.com/console/
   goto the configuration section and re-publish

You should see a bunch of files processed by the console; if not check the logs in /var/log/httpd. Note there 
will be an error for the index.html file from step 3. 

Clear your own browser cache or you may not see your changes

Some OF THESE CHANGES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THE GENERAL DISTRO
Certainly the “invisi” feature would be useful for everyone who wants to show something in the upper right hand corner
