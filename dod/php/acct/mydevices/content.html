<h3>My Devices</h3>
<p>
Your MedCommons account links to both personal and professional devices. In the personal category, a $70 blood pressure machine connected via USB created this demonstration. To try this feature, download this example <a href="A1234567890.xml">file</a> then click Browse next to the Blood Pressure to CCR Plugin below.

Professional workstations can connect directly to MedCommons to receive orders, enter reports and provide the tools for diagnostic consutations over the Web. Full diagnostic quality imaging studies are integrated with standard CCRs and take advantage of the Worklist, Group and Notification services supported by MedCommons CCR-standard personal health records. You patient's PHR accounts automatically receive and store their own diagnostic imaging in the professional DICOM format.

    Important: Although MedCommons has received <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf4/k041326.pdf">FDA clearance</a> to manage and display diagnostic images, the demonstration of the Workstation Services Plugin uses a popular open-source diagnostic workstation that is not FDA cleared. MedCommons does not recommend the clinical use of diagnostic workstations that have not been registered with the FDA.
