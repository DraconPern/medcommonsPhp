<h3>MedCommons is in business to protect your privacy.</h3>
<p class="spotlightText">In this world of private health insurance,
direct-to-consumer advertising and fee-for-service health care, consumer
privacy rights seem to depend on who you ask. On the one hand, you are asked to
compromise privacy to get employment, health insurance, and even as a condition
for treatment. On the other, privacy is misused to restrict access to your own
medical information.
</p><p>
MedCommons offers you and your caregivers a better, more polite alternative by
allowing you to control your private information as much or as little as you
see fit. Ready access to your personal health record on-line means that your
copy of your medical information can be more accurate and more up-to-date than
the information any single caregiver or institution has about you. Our
integrated group, worklist, messaging, scanned document and diagnostic imaging
features are designed to make use of your PHR easier and faster for your
caregivers wherever they may be.
</p><p>
MedCommons protects your privacy and puts you in control:
</p><p>
<ul>
    <li> Although your account may be created or sponsored by a caregiver or
    health plan, you are in full control of all information in your account and
    can restrict access, delete information or close the account at any
    time.</li>
    <li> No matter who created or sponsored your account, once you claim
    ownership of the account, we will not disclose information without your
    consent.</li>
    <li> When enabled, group access privileges to your MedCommons account are
    always clearly listed and easily revoked.</li>
    <li> MedCommons does not sell or give away information in your personal
    health record. We don't even risk keeping it together with other accounts.
    We are not a medical information bureau and do not mine the aggregated data
    of our consumers.</li>
    <li> Advertising and sponsorships can be a valuable source of information
    in healthcare. Each account holder, can choose the information they expose
    to Internet search engines, if any, on an individual basis.</li>
  </ul>

Please refer to our Terms of Use for the complete privacy policy.</p>
