A Personal Health Record, or PHR, at MedCommons consists of documents and 
messages to and from caregivers, labs and devices. Although everything is 
important, many messages contain redundant information such as the same contact 
information and the same list of allergies. Similarly, some documents, such as 
a claim dispute are irrelevant while others may be too sensitive to be 
accessible by almost anyone.
</p><p>
The Current CCR is your personal health record as it would be shown to your 
primary care doctor or a typical specialist. Think of it as the information one 
practice would most likely transfer to another if you were moving to a new 
state. MedCommons accepts messages to your PHR to and from your caregivers and 
applies simple rules to decide when the content of the message can be safely 
used to update your Current CCR. To keep things clear and simple, all messages 
are stored in their original form and all updates to the Current CCR are logged 
for easy inspection.

CCRs can include documents as enclosures. This is useful for preserving scans 
of documents such as a signed discharege summary that have narrative and legal 
value. Radiology and cardiology images are another type of CCR enclosure. 
FDA-registered diagnostic imaging is a core capability of your MedCommons 
personal health record and can be used for telemedicine and consultations with 
professional systems around the world.
