<h3>Fax In</h3>
<p>Personalized and coded cover sheets make updating a personal health record as easy as your fax machine. Registered users and their caregivers can print fax cover sheets that update the PHR with standardized PDF-format scans. You and users with access to your PHR can have the documents automatically update your Current CCR. Faxes from others will be kept separate pending your review. Incoming faxes trigger Notification by email and update the Worklist page.
