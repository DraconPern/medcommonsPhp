<p>MedCommons HealthURL account pricing is $2 / month + storage. The monthly fee covers logins 
and HealthURLs for up to 6 subscribers sharing a billing account. Storage charges are metered 
to account for storage and hosting costs. Accounts without medical imaging can expect added costs 
around a penny / month. Diagnostic imaging such as CT, MR studies varies widely in size. 
An average study of 50 MB would add about $0.04 / month. DICOM upload and fax-in to PDF are 
subject to additional one-time and page charges respectively. Contact MedCommons for volume pricing.</p>
