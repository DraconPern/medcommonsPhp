<h1>Your Very Own MedCommons</h1>
This document describes how to install, optionally customize, and then run your own copy of the MedCommons Central Services. The audience at this point shold be employees and 
friends of MedCommons.
<h2>Finding and Installing the Central System</h2>

<ul>
<li>Install Apache2.x, PHP5.x and MySQL4.x</li>
<li>Make sure you have a dedicated url or at least a clear IP address that is reachable over the internet.</li>
<li>Go to Subversion /trunk/php and export the full tree to your local file system. As of 06 Sept 06 there were 748 files totalling 5.5MB in the distro, all rooted right here.</il>
<li>Move the include directory to your php include directory, wherever that may be (preferrably not publicly accessible)</li>
<li>Move the /www directory to your public website</li>
<li>Move the remaining folders to your secure website(s)</li>
<li>Edit the urls.inc.php file in your include directory. You probably just need to enter the domain name for your servers</li>
<li>Configure Tables</li>
<li>Configure Federation</li>
<li>Obtain and start an Identity Server</li>
</ul>
<h3>urls.inc.php</h3>
/var/php/urls.inc.php is the center of the configuration universe. You can modify this file and stretch the different MedCommons Services
over a collection of servers, or you can leave them alone and make only two edits. You only need to specify the base urls or your
unprotected (http) and protected (https) web services 
<h3>Table Configuration</h3>
/var/php/medcommons.sql contains a full schema with some initial data for inclusion into your new system. Do not modify this file.
Load it directly into MySQL using your preferred tool. It will create four databases. that are used by the application.
<p>You can run the program /secure/once.php to set up your tables. You will be asked to specify which gateway you will be using
for creating new CCRs and other documents</p>
<h3>Setting Up A Gateway</h3>
If you are not very interested in creating new CCRs you can probably get by without setting up a gateway. But for most applications you will
need to set one up. 
<h2>Pimp My StartPage</h2>
If you have any experience with PHP  you can rig up your own personal start page on MedCommons. What's a start page? It's the place
you go automatically when you successfully log on.
<p>Here's how:
<h3>General Flow</h3>
<p>Upon Successful Logon the Identity Server sets the MC cookie and takes you to the location identitied in the Servers Table, slot 1. This has probably been
wired to <i>accountsURL</i>/goStart.php</o>
<p>goStart.php reads the user;s cookie and then the user record to obtain the users 'rolehack' value. Rolehack is interpreted by goStart.php
as a general selector, but might be utilized differently (eg to contain a particular URL) with appropriate editing</p>
<p>Most of the pages that goStart invokes utlize the layout() and stdlayout() apis in <i>accountsURL</i>/layout.inc.php to build a general page, and a standard page
respectively. The general page is composed of five sections (top, left, center, right, bottom) all of which can be set by you. Typically, you will want most of the standard sections 
and thus will use stdlayout() which only allows for modification of the central section
<p>The general account page built from <i>accountsURL</i>/mypage.inc.php is composed of separate sections identified by lowercase letters a-z and could easily be extended
to A-Z as well These sections are available as Google Gadgets, alone, or in combination, and can also be blended right into the middle sectin of  your start page.
<h3>Adding a new section to mypage.inc.php</h3>
You can write a bunch of your own code, and either put it into MedCommons, or iframe it.
</ul>
<li>Modify the tables in <i>accountsURL</i>/pickcomp.php to identity and label the new section</li>
<li>Write your PHP, typically putting it in <i>accountsURL</i>, but that is not required </li>
<li>Add the corresponding glue code in <i>accountsURL</i>/mypage.inc.php taking care to not break anything else</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it. For instructions on how to configure sections for google see <a href=http://medcommons.net/trackers>this</a></p>
