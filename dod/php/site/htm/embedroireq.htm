<h2>How to Embed an ROI Form in Your Own Website</h2>
<p>Just supply MedCommons with an HTTP POST of an  html form that you offer to your users on your website. 
When filled by the user, it is always posted to 
https://www.medcommons.net/hipaaroireq.php. Once a valid form is entered by the user, MedCommons generates a receipt with an ROI ID that can be
utilized to retrieve the original form.  </p>
<h3>Form Specification</h3>
<p>This is a web developer dump of the form you must supply. Any of the fields can be hidden or not at your discretion. You can leave the checkboxes as is,
or set them to type hidden and change their values from 'on' to ''</p>

<p>MedCommons will error check the three required fields (name, dob, and email) and any supplied optional fields</p>
<h3>Handling Errors</h3>
<p>MedCommons will error check all fields to ensure only safe requests are entered. Any errors encountered will either be displayed on a Mod form
to the end user, or will be posted to another program if the "repost" variable is supplied with a non blank URL</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  from our own site at <a href=embedexample.html>embedexample.html</a>
  </li>
    <li>
  from  some other examples from the <a href='http://apps.medcommons.net/is12/axioexample.html'>axio sports site</a>
