                        complete system is running and available for individual and unaffiliated users at
                        www.medcommons.net, but most users work with a partner of MedCommons who has licensed
                        the<span class='productname'>MedCommons Inside</span> infrastructure and is running
                        it in its own data centers, at a third party hosting facility, or at a range of
                        hosts operated by MedCommons, Inc.

                    <p>
                        Every MedCommons licensee can proceed with confidence that any PHR account created
                        for any patient or healthcare provider can be accessed from any MedCommons-enabled
                        system. Each licensee is given a distinct pool of account numbers and PHRs to allocate
                        as they see fit. Any user connecting to any MedCommons enabled site is automatically
                        redirected to the correct PHR regardless of when and where it was created.

                        What If I Don't Want to See Ads?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A licensee chooses whether to show ads or not. On www.medcommons.net, you can always
                        upgrade to an ad-free, premium account</p>
                    <h3>
                        What Happens If My MedCommons Provider Goes Out of Business?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a licensee goes out of business, we will host all his accounts for free at www.medcommons.net
                        for one year, to allow everyone to find another MedCommons Provider, or upgrade
                        to a premium account</p>
                    <h3>
                        How Does MedCommons Provide Universal Accessibility?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every MedCommons licensee can proceed with confidence that any PHR account created
                        for any patient or healthcare provider can be accessed from any MedCommons-enabled
                        system. Each licensee is given a distinct pool of account numbers and PHRs to allocate
                        as they see fit. Any user connecting to any MedCommons enabled site is automatically
                        redirected to the correct PHR regardless of when and where he was created.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Can I Do Anything on www.medcommons.net that I can't do as a Licensee?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely not. The retail site at www.medcommons.net uses the same Licensee Integration
                        Components and APIs that all licensees utilize. In fact, as a licensee you can do
                        a much deeper custom integration into your healthcare infrastructure than you can
                        do with the retail site.</p>
                    <h3>
                        As A Licensee Does It Matter Where I Choose to Host?</h3>
                    <p>
                        However you choose to host your MedCommons-enabled service, when you license <span
                            class='productname'>MedCommons Inside</span> you can embed all of our components
                        and techologies into your existing applications and services.

                    <p>
                        Different hosting solutions will have different price/performance characteristics.
                        Some licensees will choose premium hosting solutions with redundant disks, remote
                        realtime backup sites, and additional reliability options</p>
