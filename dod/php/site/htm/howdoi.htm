  <ul>
    <li>by Tracking Number / PIN: This is the easiest way for the
doctor to open your HealthURL and be directed to a particular CCR.
Here's what to do: 
    <ul >
      <li>Click to the Edit CCR mode</li>
      <li>Enter a PIN</li>
      <li>Click Save. </li>
      <li>Communicate the tracking number and pin to the doctor using
the built-in email Notification by clicking Send or use a regular
email, text message or call. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> by doctor's Email Address, if you don't want to use the PIN
 
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the doctor's email address in the CCR Notification form.</li>
      <li>Click Send. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Lacking a PIN, the doctor will need to open a MedCommons
account ($2/mo via Amazon Payments) and verify their email address
before access. If the doctor doesn't have a MedCommons account, she
will be invited to open one. </li>
    </ul>
       </li>
    <li>by doctor's OpenID, if your doctor has an OpenID from an
approved identity service MedCommons will accept it. This option avoids
the doctor having to register and pay for an account. We support
Verisign, it's free.
    <ul>
      <li>Click Dashboard and the Share with OpenID link.</li>
      <li>Enter the OpenID on the form.</li>
      <li>Copy a link to the HealthURL (on the Dashboard) or Tracking
Number (on the Dashboard Activity Log) and send it to the doctor. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The doctor will log into their OpenID to access your
HealthURL. They will not need to register or pay MedCommons.</li>
