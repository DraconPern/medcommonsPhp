<p>
MedCommons on Demand vouchers allow you to charge the client for your information-based services such as records release and diagnostic imaging.
Vouchers are linked to temporary HealthURLs that expire automatically after a period you specify.
Vouchers can also be free for services that just require simple, HIPAA-compliant patient communications on the Web.
Vouchers can be created in seconds from our templates or custom designed to carry your instructions,logo and branding.
