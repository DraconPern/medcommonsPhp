    MedCommons ('MedCommons') is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors
    to its medcommons.net web site (the 'Site'). The purpose of this Privacy
    Policy is to inform you what kinds of information we may gather about you
    when you visit the Site, how we may use that information, whether we
    disclose it and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability
    to manage and edit, the information. This Privacy Policy applies to the
    Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other web sites to which we
    link.

    Introduction
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoBodyText2 id=vc5g>
    The Site is a health records platform that allows you and your designated
    sources to collect personal information on your behalf. You can also share
    your personal information with family, friends, and health care
    professionals as well as with separate tools and software applications
    (each, an "Application") available online. Such Applications might be used
    to collect, edit, process and search for relevant information.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=x:q6>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=e.ff>
    The Site is organized into Accounts typically representing a single
    individual. An Account contains private information for the purpose of
    identifying the individual (e.g.: name, email address) as well as private
    medical information (e.g.: allergies, medications, diagnoses, lab results,
    hospitals and health history).
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=e.ff>
    <BR id=ofxm>
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=e.ff>
    The Site is designed to allow a great deal of control to the patient-owner
    of any private information collected on their behalf. This includes the
    ability for a caregiver to create an Account about you and then transfer
    ownership of the account to you; the ability for you to download
    substantially all documents in your owned account in a convenient format; to
    delete access to others who may have created the Account about you; to
    delete the account contents in part or their entirety. Although we ask for
    personal identifying and contact information in order to provide reliable
    and convenient service, we also allow account owners to be identified
    anonymously and to link their accounts to external and independent
    third-party authentication services. Social networks are an example of such
    a third-party authentication service.<BR id=i4on>

    Information Collection
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=nrzg>
    We collect personal information to identify users and as part of the health
    records managed by the Site. We use the information that you provide for the
    following general purposes:
  </P>
  <ul>
  <li>to fulfill your requests for use of
    certain features of the Site
</li>
  <li>to contact you
</li>
  <li> to connect your Account on the Site to
    other external accounts and Applications that you choose
</li>
    <li> to assemble your health record
</li>
  <li>
  to determine and control who else can
    access the Account on the Site.
</li>
    </ul>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=pc90>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=xh9o>
    Information we collect for the purpose of accessing external Applications
    may include passwords or security tokens that identify you as the authorized
    user.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=uyev>
    &nbsp;
  </P>

  <P class=MsoNormal id=d7g4>
    You can authorize external Applications and other&nbsp;third parties&nbsp;to
    add, view, modify and/or delete information in the Account. Please refer to
    the privacy statements of those Applications for information about their
    privacy policies and how they will use the information they access.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=d7g4>
    <BR id=nvcv>
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=nqdt>
    By default, Accounts are controlled by one or more "custodians," initially
    the user or Application that created the Account. Additional Account
    custodians may be added to the list of custodians at the time of Account
    creation or subsequently. Control of an account can be passed from one
    custodian to another. For example, a doctor can create an account for the
    purpose of medical referral (in which case, the doctor would be the
    custodian) and then transfer control of the Account to the patient to use as
    a personal health record (in which case, the patient would be the
    custodian). The patient might then choose to assume sole control of the
    account and revoke or continue access privileges to the original or other
    doctor(s) as desired.

    Through the Site, we automatically gather certain information about the use
    of the Site, such as the how frequently certain areas of the Site are
    visited including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other
    technologies. We also collect standard information that your browser sends
    to every web site you visit such as browser type, IP address, language,
    access times and referring Web site address.<BR id=po_l>

    Information Collection Applications
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=x672>
    The Site provides add-on information collection Applicationsthat can be used
    to acquire medical images and other records from your computer or network
    and to store such medical images and records on your computer or network. If
    you choose to install and use such an add-on Application, the information on
    your computer or network is not under the control of the Site and should be
    protected by you (such as by using firewalls and virus scanners) and deleted
    as soon as practical.

    Disclosure
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=ih2g>
    The Site is designed to facilitate disclosure of medical record information
    under strict control and consent. Sharing of medical information allows care
    management for a family member or friend, consultation with your health care
    provider or an independent second-opinion. Disclosure to an external
    Application allows processing to detect errors or drug interactions and
    communications with imaging scanners and hospital networks that are
    otherwise inaccessible from the Internet.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=e9jf>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=my_b>
    Sharing is controlled by designated Account custodian(s). Access can be
    granted to users that are authenticated by the Site (and subject to this
    Site's policies and password check) and to users that are authenticated by
    third-party sites that are trusted by any custodian of your Account. For
    example, you may grant access to a user authenticated by an OpenID service
    provider (e.g.: Verisign PIP) without requiring the user to store a password
    or other private information on the Site. See "Independent Third Party
    Authentication", below).

    How We Use Your Personal Information
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=z9qu>
    We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We may
    permit certain trusted partners to access your information in connection
    with their performance of services to maintain and operate the Site and
    certain features on the Site on our behalf such as processing credit card
    payments and converting faxes into PDF documents for your account. We do not
    otherwise disclose any personal information that you provide to us or any
    information about your individual visits to our site except when we believe
    in good faith (i) that the law requires such disclosure or (ii) that such
    disclosure is necessary to protect the rights and property of MedCommons or
    others.<BR id=ys60>
    <BR id=ppa5>
    We use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so that we
    can improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We also
    may use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that
    contains no personally identifiable information. We do not use your personal
    information from the Site for marketing or solicitation without first asking
    and receiving your consent.<BR id=jxo5>

    Updating Personal Information and Preferences
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=z9qu>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoBodyText id=e0eg>
    Your account is created by you or a custodian on your behalf and includes
    personal information owned by you. Proof of ownership of an account at the
    Site is documented by possession of the Registration Page. Accounts created
    by a custodian on your behalf can be claimed by their owner with the
    cooperation of the custodian(s).
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=a5i:>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=hses>
    Any user or application with Write privilege to the Account will be able to
    modify and delete information thereby making it inaccessible to others. The
    Account provides owners a Download All Documents feature that can be used to
    conveniently create a separate archive outside of the Account.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=hses>
    <BR id=idb0>
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=aaip>
    The owner of an account can modify or delete information in the Account.
    Modification of digitally signed information may invalidate the digital
    signature. Deletion of a document or information item may leave a log of the
    deletion event for security purposes. Custodians of Accounts that are not
    owned can modify and delete all contents.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=aaip>
    <BR id=pj96>
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=bxav>
    The owner of an Account can close their Account. Custodians of accounts that
    are not owned can also close an Account. Information in an Account that is
    closed will become inaccessible immediately and will be deleted in 90 days.
    This time is chosen to minimize the risk of accidental or malicious
    deletion. Deleted Accounts can may be restorable by contacting the Site
    support office.

    Third Party Authentication
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=u1dz>
    Accounts on the Site can be created by a custodian authenticated by a
    third-party unrelated to the operator of the Site. Social networking sites
    are a common example of a third-party authenticator that may be linked to
    the Site. This feature enables single sign-on, protects privacy by reducing
    the amount of personal information the Site must collect, allows for
    anonymous accounts and makes it convenient for caregivers to create accounts
    on a person's behalf. Accounts that are created subject to authentication of
    a third party may be unreachable directly from the Site for purposes of
    access, update or closure. To enable direct control of an Account in case
    they lose access to or the cooperation of the third-party authenticator,
    custodians and owners should establish an email and password at the Site as
    well as print and keep their Account Recovery Page safely in their files.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=t1ya>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=wy:9>
    The Site reserves the right to deny authentication privileges to a

    Sharing Private Account Information with Users and Applications
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=fpr5>
    Any custodian&nbsp;of an Account on the Site may enable access to some or
    all of the account by other users, groups and applications. Users, groups
    and applications may be authenticated by the Site or by third-party
    authenticators acceptable to the custodian or owner of the Account that
    authorizes the access. The Site does not monitor the credentials or restrict
    third-party authenticators you authorize for access to your Account. By
    authorizing access you (or another custodian) are asserting that the person,
    group or application is able to access the specific Account on the Site that
    you control as custodian.<BR id=z4.i>
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=ouja>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=mlc4>
    Groups and applications that are granted access to your account may
    represent one or more individual users. Group membership or access to the
    application is beyond the Site's control. DO NOT AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO GROUPS
    OR APPLICATIONS AS AUTHENTICATED BY THE SITE OR BY A THIRD PARTY
    AUTHENTICATOR UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE PRIVACY POLICY OF THE
    SITE OR THE THIRD PARTY AUHENTICATOR OR APPLICATION.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=obxa>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=nl-0>
    The Site may allow sharing of a subset of the account in order to restrict
    access by different groups and facilitate second opinions. It is your
    responsibility to understand and configure these restrictions appropriately.
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=gr8s>
    &nbsp;
  </P>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=ny4a>
    The Site may assign tracking numbers and PIN numbers to some documents. The
    tracking numbers are not personally-identifiable information and might be
    transmitted conveniently in email. The PIN may be communicated directly by
    you or another authorized user of the Account to another user such as over a
    phone to allow access to the document via the tracking number. Please
    exercise great caution in using the PIN feature. Once a PIN is disclosed, it
    is out of your control and may be abused or shared by multiple users without
    a specific record to document how many different users gained access.

    Notification Messages
  </H3>
  <P class=MsoNormal id=yw_v>
    The Site uses email, SMS and other potentially insecure methods to alert
    designated users of Account activity. These messages typically include a
    tracking number and a user-editable text field describing the purpose or
    subject. Do not include personally-identifiable information in the
    notification text field.
