    <em>International Use.</em>

MedCommons makes no representation that materials available on the Site

  <li>
    <em>Third Party Sites.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
The Site may link you to other web sites on the Internet.
  
These other web sites are not under the control of MedCommons, and
you acknowledge that MedCommons is not responsible for the accuracy,
copyright compliance, legality, decency or any other aspect of the
content of such sites. The inclusion of such a link does not imply
endorsement of the site by MedCommons or any association with its
operators.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE
THROUGH THE SITE (THE &lsquo;CONTENT&rsquo;) ARE PROVIDED
&lsquo;AS IS&rsquo; AND &lsquo;AS AVAILABLE&rsquo; FOR YOUR USE.

THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

MEDCOMMONS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR
CORRECT; THAT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR
LOCATION; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE
CONTENT IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS SOLELY AT YOUR RISK. BECAUSE SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THESE
EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MEDCOMMONS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT
RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE. THIS LIMITATION
APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF MEDCOMMONS
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damagers, MedCommons&apos; liability in such
jurisdictions shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.

You may recover from MedCommons only direct damages up to the amount
you paid to MedCommons in connection with your use of the Site during
the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to such liability.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>Release and Waiver.</em>

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release,
and waive all claims against MedCommons and its employees and agents
from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and
consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and
attorneys&apos; fees) of every kind and nature, arising out of or in
any way connected with use of the Site.

If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under
California Civil Code ï¿½1542, which states, &lsquo;A general release does
not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known
by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor.&rsquo;

Residents of other states and nations similarly waive their rights
under applicable and/or analogous laws, statutes or regulations.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>Indemnification.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MedCommons, and its
employees, contractors, officers and directors from all liabilities,
claims and expenses, including attorneys&apos; fees, that arise from
your use or misuse of the Site.

MedCommons reserves the right, at it own expense, to assume the
exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with
MedCommons in asserting any available defenses.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>Termination.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
MedCommons reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or
terminate your access to all or part of the Site, with or without
notice.

  </li>

  <li>
    <em>Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on the
Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide
the following information to MedCommons:

<ul>
 <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act
     on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;</li>

 <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
     information in your notice is accurate and that you are the

    <em>Choice of Law and Forum.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts
of law rules.

You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or
action arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or your use of
the Site shall be the state or federal courts located in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and you further agree and submit to the
exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of

  <li>
    <em>Miscellaneous.</em>
    <span class='desc'>
Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms of Use, together with the
Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and
MedCommons with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or
electronic) between you and MedCommons with respect to the Site.

If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that
portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to
reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties,
and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.

The failure of MedCommons to act with respect to a breach by you or
others does not waive MedCommons&apos; right to act with respect to
subsequent or similar breaches.

MedCommons&apos; failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision
of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision.

The section headings contained in these Terms of Use are included for
convenience only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of
these Terms of Use.
