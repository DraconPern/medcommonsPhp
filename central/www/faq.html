                    <h3>1) What is MedCommons?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons is a patient-controlled medical data bank. Like any
                        bank, MedCommons depends on the trust of its customers to stay in business.</p>
                    <a href="#top">back to top</a>
                    <a name="2"></a>
                    <h3>2) Why call MedCommons a bank? </h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons reminds us that there are many valuable uses for
                        private medical data. This data belongs to the patient and only to the
                        patient. It is the patient's choice if and when and how to share this data
                        with physicians, insurance companies and various companies.</p>
                    <p class="p2">A commons is a resource which is accessible to anyone.
                        Interoperable communication of private medical data, when managed with the
                        voluntary and informed consent of the patient, can help to improve health
                        care for all by facilitating scientific research, objectively demonstrating
                        quality and by promoting public health and safety.</p>
                    <p class="p2">In the Internet age, the ability to control private information
                        using non-proprietary protocols is as essential as having a universally
                        accepted currency was during the Industrial Revolution. Privacy and
                        voluntary participation are the foundation for trust in MedCommons as they
                        are in modern banking practice.</p>
                    <a href="#top">back to top</a>

                    <h3>3) Will my physicians accept and use MedCommons?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons is based on the physician's own Continuity of Care
                        Record standard. In the words of the ASTM standards organization:"The CCR,
                        or Continuity of Care Record, is a standard specification that has been
                        developed over the past two years jointly by ASTM International, the
                        Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS), the Health Information Management and
                        Systems Society (HIMSS), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP),
                        the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association (AMA),
                        the Patient Safety Institute, the American Health Care Association, the
                        National Association for the Support of Long Term Care, and the Mobile
                        Healthcare Alliance. The remarkable success in achieving widespread
                        consensus and early sponsorship of the professional societies and
                        organizations listed above (others are pending) is a testimony to the power
                        and the timing of the concepts and the methodology supporting the CCR. This
                        new specification is intended to foster and improve continuity of patient
                        care, to reduce medical errors, and to assure at least a minimum standard of
                        health information transportability when a patient is referred or
                        transferred to, or is otherwise seen by, another provider".</p>

                    <h3>4) Will enterprises accept and use MedCommons?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons supports Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise profiles
                        representing "best practices" for integration within enterprises.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Furthermore, MedCommons will release any of its software hosted by
                        the enterprise under an OSI-certified Open Source license that enables
                        everyone including providers and vendors to review, use, modify and embed
                        the key components of IHE for free.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Relevant components of the MedCommons Gateway to the enterprise
                        have already received clearance by the FDA.</p>

                    <h3>5) How will MedCommons make money? </h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons will provide eReferral transfer services and private
                        medical data banking services to patients and their physicians.</p>

                    <h3>6) Referrals usually take days and cost plenty as I chase around town
                        looking for films. Will MedCommons handle medical images such as CT and MR
                        scans?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">Yes.</p>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons uses the CCR to organize referrals and links
                        diagnostic-quality radiology images and PDF format documents to the CCR.</p>

                        computers?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">In most cases, nothing at all. MedCommons is securely accessible
                        to physicians and patients alike via modern Web browsers and email. This
                        includes the ability to create and modify CCRs , and attach scanned
                        documents in PDF format.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Electronic health record systems are not required for access to
                        MedCommons. Those EHR systems that import and export CCR files will be able
                        to send and receive them directly to and from any patient or physician
                        MedCommons account with MedCommons management of patient consent and HIPAA
                        mandated procedures.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Simple, user-installed Web browser plugins and open-source
                        gateways will support DICOM attachments, radiologist workstations and PACS
                        interfaces.</p>
                    <p class="p2">The MedCommons Gateway is FDA-registered Free/ Open Source
                        Software and will be available for free download once our pilot testing is

                        Health Information Network?</h3>
                    <p class="p2">MedCommons is being offered as an open and standards-based
                        solution to the patient-control component of the NHIN. We intend to work
                        with Regional Health Information Organizations and other pilot programs as

                    <p class="p2">MedCommons is independent of both health care and insurance
                        providers. By providing true portability and world-wide access to health
                        resources, MedCommons is well suited to consumer-directed insurance plans
                        and may be offered as a convenient link to consumer-controlled health
                        savings account payment cards.</p>

                    <p class="p2">Only if you choose to allow it and to the extent required by law.
                        MedCommons will make it easy to make selective copies of your private data
                        and transfer those copies to physicians, family members and other people as
                        you see fit. In case none of your selected proxies are available, future
                        releases of MedCommons will support access by emergency personnel to a
