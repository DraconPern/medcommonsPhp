               <h3>About  Us</h3>
                <h3>ADRIAN GROPPER, M.D. - Chief Science Officer</h3> 
                <p class="p2">Adrian has pioneered the use of computers and the Internet to deliver diagnostics to all physicians. For over 25 years, Adrian has used a combination of engineering and medicine to transition sophisticated diagnostics out of the specialist's lab and into everyday practice. Today, he's at the forefront of making diagnostics accessible directly to patients over the World Wide Web. </p> 
                <p class="p2">Adrian's career as a medical device developer began with undergraduate education in mechanical engineering and computer simulation at MIT, graduation from Harvard Medical School, and internship at the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center. Adrian served as Director of Biomedical Research at Orion Research, Inc, Adrian pioneered the field of &quot;physician's office&quot; diagnostics with the first whole blood analyzer designed for use outside of a laboratory setting. Adrian was co-founder of Analytix, Inc. and developer of the first robotic blood analyzer. </p> 
                <p class="p2">Adrian's work on imaging and affiliation with Massachusetts General Hospital began in 1991 with early work on the Center for Innovative Minimally Invasive Therapy, a joint project of the MGH departments of radiology and surgery. As Chief Technology Officer of RSTAR, Inc,he ran pioneering telemedicine projects throughout the world that spawned first generation of commercial diagnostic Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS). </p> 
                <p class="p2">In 1995, Adrian Gropper and Sean Doyle founded AMICAS(NYSE:AMCS) Inc, to bring diagnostic quality images to physicians outside of the radiology department PACS by using Internet technology. AMICAS' 1997 FDA-clearance of its flagship product preceded the next Web-based image management system by some 18 months. Today, AMICAS' Web-based PACS technology is installed in over 400 facilities including such flagships as MGH, Boston Medical Center, New York Presbyterian and Cornell Medical Centers and The University of Chicago. </p> 
                <h3>SEAN DOYLE - CTO</h3> 
                <p class="p2">Sean's career has focused on making clinically centered software ubiquitously available through use of standards and commodity infrastructure. After graduating with an economics degree from MIT, Sean developed econometric and statistical diagnostic algorithms at the MIT Center for Computational Research, and at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, DC., and at the World Bank. Sean's imaging career started in 1989 when he joined the RSTAR project at Massachusetts General Hospital's Department of Radiology. </p> 
                <p class="p2">Sean served as Director of Software Engineering at RSTAR. which was later spun out the first commercial PACS vendor in 1992., Sean developed a structured measuring tool for an osteoporosis, deployed as part of the first completely digital imaging and measurement clinical trial cleared by the FDA. Returning to the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994, Sean developed a visual Bayesian calculator for computing probabilities of various genetic disorders constructed the initial prototypes for a patient-centered life-long medical record. </p> 
                <p class="p2">In 1995 Adrian Gropper and Sean Doyle founded AMICAS . to deliver clinical imaging applications built on web standards. Via judicious combination of protocols and formats AMICAS was able to deliver images using wavelets streaming over HTTP to the browsers on clinical desktops for fast, ubiquitous access. </p> 
                <p class="p2">Sean is a member of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and the SVP (Society of Vertebrate Paleontology). </p> 
                <h3>BILL DONNER - CEO</h3> 
                <p class="p2">Bill Donner's career has focused on designing, building, financing and promoting the development of large scale online transaction processing systems for large user communities. After a obtaining a BSEE from MIT, he joined Digital Equipment Corporation, traveling internationally to set up and plan applicaton development at large DecSystem-10 customer installations. </p> 
                <p class="p2">In the early 1980s, Bill built and ran Precision Business Systems; a Wall St. based Systems Integrator. PBS built and installed a variety of innovative systems including global communications switches and networks for Goldman Sachs, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan, and Bank of America, securities clearance systems for Bank of New York and Security Pacific, money transfer systems for Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Irving Trust and others, a Japanese facsimile switching network for Nikko Securities, an airline check in network for VASP, the Brazilian state run airline, and the PriceWatch trading room systems for Chemical Bank in London, SGB in New York, and the floor system for the Montreal Stock Exchange. </p> 
                <p class="p2">Precision Business Systems was sold to the Bank of America in 1988 and subsequently, a division was sold to Reuters, PLC where Bill ran the Reuters Dealing 2001 and 2002 Trading Services. These proprietary networks service 30,000 online traders at 8,000 banks and brokerages in a 7*24*365 network. In today's parlance, Dealing 2001 is a peer based instant messaging service that utilizes real-time content analysis to build structured financial transactions for spot foreign exchange, while Dealing 2002 is a centralized anonymous automated matching service for currency exchange. </p> 
                <p class="p2">In 1994 Bill was named Chief Architect of Reuters which at that time consisted of ten disparate networks, eight database services, 90,000 servers, and 500,000 users sitting at terminals. Bill ran the central research group, which focused on investigating and prototyping new technologies for automated content generation and analysis, video production and playback, object databases, rights management and security . </p> 
                <p class="p2">Bill joined the Greenhouse Group, Reuters' corporate venture capital arm, in 1996. The Greenhouse Group invested in a number of companies that were successfully integrated into either the company's infrastructure: Tibco, realtime messaging and inter-enterprise integration (IPO), Intertrust, digital rights management (IPO), Digimarc, content watermarking (IPO), Verisign, public key infrastructure security (IPO), or the company's new distribution exoskeleton: Yahoo (IPO), Infoseek (IPO) and Factiva (a Dow Jones-Reuters business information portal). </p> 
                <p class="p2">After returning to America in 1999, Bill joined Fenway Partners, a leading NY Private Equity Fund where he led the technology investment group. Fenway's technology investments include Tradeum, an exchange software provider (sold to VerticalNet), Supplier Market, a procurement network for custom built products (sold to Ariba), Wiscom, a 3G Wcdma wireless chip design house (IP sold to Intel), Odigo, a cellular instant messaging infrastructure provider (sold to Comverse), and iRobot. Privately, Bill was an angel investor in WebLogic, inventors of the Java application server (sold to BEA Systems), AMICAS, a leading PACS vendor, Kenamea, a secure messaging middleware platform provider, and Visible World, developers of personalized television commercial delivery and insertion systems. </p>
