                    <h3>Terms of Use</h3> 
                    <p class="p2">NOT FOR CLINICAL USE - This is a trial version of the MedCommons system. Please send comments to <a href="mailto:cso@medcommons.org">cso@medcommons.org</a>.</p> 
                    <p class="p2">LIMITED PRIVACY - This trial is not secure. Please do not post any private or patient-identifiable information. MedCommons monitors this site and collects information about visitors. Information collected during this trial and demonstration phase is for internal use and will not be sold to third parties. </p> 
                    <p class="p2">BEST EFFORTS - CCRs will be managed on a best-efforts on availability basis. Since we assume that the information is still available at the source and that the destination and source must communicate the PIN, lack of availability can be mitigated by resending the information. </p> 
                    <p class="p2">TEMPORARY STORAGE - Any document in transit through MedCommons is subject to deletion without notice at any time. PINs and the information they control will expire without notice. </p> 
                    <p class="p2">NO SUPPORT - Information is secured with a PIN code that you must save. We will not recover the information if you lose the PIN. </p> 
                    <p class="p2">SPAM - Email addresses we collect during this trial period may be used to notify users when updates become available. The addresses will not be sold or passed on to any other party and we will gladly remove your email from our list at any time. </p> 
                    <p class="p2">This policy will be updated as the trial period continues. Please check this page and the associated documentation. </p>
