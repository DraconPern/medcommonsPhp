<h2>CCR Exchange Protocol Home Page</h2>
<p>The CCR Exchange Protocol is the smallest means we could think of for getting two systems from different vendors, on different OS's, in different security domains to move and store CCRs. 

<p>CXP is layered on top of HTTP and thus can be utilized just about anywhere.

<p>CXP is a two party protocol. The Sender transfers CCRs to a Receiver. A Client can issue a Query to a CXP Server to find a particular CCR. 

<p>In the open software php distro, the CXP Server is a Receiver, and a separate utility CXPCMD is the Sender or Client. But you can and should write your own implementation of CXP.
