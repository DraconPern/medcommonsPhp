<h3>CXPCMD - CXP Command Utility Information</h3>
<p>CXPCMD Command Utility uses the <a href=cxprotocol.pdf>CXP Protocol</a> to allow CCRs and Attachments to be Transferred and Queried to and from a Remote CXPServer  
<p>The utility has no user interface. It is instead driven by an xml file that describes the operation(s) for the CXP Command Utility to Perform
.<small>The format of the xml file is <a href=cxpcmd.txt>described here</small></a>
<p>
<p>To invoke CXPCMD via a URL:<br><br>
http://localhost/cxpcmd.php?cfg=xmlfile.xml where xmlfile is as described above
<p>Or, if you are feeling lazy you can just execute one of the pre-canned test cases down below:
<h3>CXP Data Logs</h3>
<p>CXPServ and CXPCMD leave trails in several directories:
<br> 
<p><small>examine <a href="../serverdata">/serverdata</a> recorded by CXPServ
<br>examine <a href="../clientdata">/clientdata</a> recorded by CXPCommand
<br>examine <a href="../notificationdata">/notificationdata</a> recorded by Client Notification Handlers
</small>
<p>This is pretty much where we are leaving this demo software. Please feel free to improve the software.
