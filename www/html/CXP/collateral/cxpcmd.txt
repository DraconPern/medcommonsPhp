This note describes the format of the CXPCMD input file. 

This format is local to this particular utility and is unrelated to the CXP protocol.

The entire xml document is enclosed in matching <cxpcommand> ... </cxpcommand>

The remote CXPServer to contact is enclosed in <remoteurl> tags - right now only http is supported

Optionally a <repeatinterval> tag specifies an interval in seconds to repeat the entire command stream via an http Refresh header

Optionally a <repeatcount> tag specifies how many times to execute the set of commands that follow

Optionally, the caller may specify a key within the <callerskey> tags to pass a string that will be turned around and passed back to the caller in the future

Optionally, the <opcode> field specifies the operation to perform

If no <opcode> field is present, then the cxpcommand is an implied TRANSFER
In this case there is but one additional tag, the <ccrfile> which is the CCR to transfer

If an <opcode> tag is present, it can have any of the following values:

If QUERY, then a query string parameter can be passed as part of the <querystring> field and optionally a notification URL can be passed as <querynotificationurl>

If TRANSFER, additional attachments can be specified as part of the <attachments> section

The <attachments> section consists of single line <attachment>entries for each file to be attached:
The TYPE attribute specifies the kind of file to be transmitted (txt,xml,pdf,etc)
The LINK attribute specifies the name of the reference in the CCR for this attachment
The value of the entry itslef is the file specification for the document to be attached.

Please examine the testcases for working examples.
