                    <p class="p1">Personal health records will become the authoritative and
                        supremely private representation of each of us in digital form. Healthy or
                        not, most of us will want to safeguard and control what of our genome,
                        family history, high resolution scans and medications can potentially reach
                        all physicians and the most innovative of health care providers. </p>
                    <p class="p1">The Commons is a private and secure way for any patient to
                        communicate <em>specific portions</em> of their personal health record with
                        any health care provider that has access to the Internet, for free, using
                        open and standardized digital documents that are readily accessible to both
                        patients and physicians. </p>
                    <p class="p1">The Commons, as implemented by MedCommons, is also an inexpensive
                        way of achieving interoperability among health information systems in
                        hospitals, public health agencies and research labs without coercive
                        credit-bureau-like information warehouses. </p>

                        the Commons eXchange Protocol, the next generation of personal health
                        records, enterprise health systems and medical devices will enable
                        caregivers to respect patient privacy and honor their trust by offering
                        import and export connections via The Commons.</p>
