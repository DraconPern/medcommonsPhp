                        <h3>CXP Protocol</h3>
                        <p class="p2">CXP is an example of point-to-point CCR transport between PHR,EHR and other Healthcare
                            systems. MedCommons has placed CXP into the public domain in order to
                            stimulate comment from EHR vendors and other interested parties.</p>
                        <p class="p2">The CXP protocols are demonstrated by a Firefox extension
                            (PC/Mac) that makes it convenient to cross firewalls separating EHR
                            applications by using a Web accessible CXP server as intermediary. You
                            are free to install your own CXP server from the public domain
                            distribution. </p>
                        <p class="p2">MedCommons operates an enhanced CXP server that
                            anyone can use. This server will send a MedCommons email notification
                            based on emails found in the TO and FROM actors of a CCR. MedCommons
                            tracks this email activity. We hope you will use the MedCommons server
                            as much as possible - it's free - please send feedback to <a
                                href="mailto:cmo@medcommons.net">cmo@medcommons.net</a> or to the
                            CCR Accelerator Group. </p>

                        <h3>CCR Client</h3>
                        <img alt="demoshot1" class="inlinepic" src="images/demoshot_1.jpg"/>
                        <p class="caption">Figure 1</p>
                        <p class="p2">The CCR Client demonstrates EHR to Web and direct EHR to EHR
                            transport using the CXP Protocol. A CCR saved from an EHR is picked up
                            by the local CCR Client, transported by MedCommons using CXP and becomes
                            available to any other EHR user that has a CCR Client installed.</p>
                        <p class="p2">MedCommons, acting as the intermediary transport agent,
                            facilitates interoperability testing by adding:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>an email notification feature based on Actors in the CCR itself, </li>
                            <li>an online CCR viewer, and </li>
                            <li>a central problem blog to facilitate community-based resolution of
                                incompatibilities and other interoperability problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="p2">The CCR Client is just an interoperability testing tool. It is
                            assumed that all CCRs are completely anonymous and created explicitly to
                            demonstrate the implementation of various features of the ASTM CCR
                            standard by participating EHR vendors.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Install Firefox and the CCR Client Firefox Extension <ul>
                                    <li>Download and install Firefox (FF go to <a
                                            href="http://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a> to get
                                        a copy). Please ensure your Firefox is at version 1.5.02 or
                                        later.</li>
                                    <li>Download the most recent version of the CCR Client , from
                                        the link on the MedCommons home page to your hard drive. (<a

                                    <li>Exit Firefox and double-click the extension file. It will
                                        open with Firefox. Click the Install button when it appears</li>
                                    <li>Note: you must have "allow websites to install plug-ins"
                                        checked in your preferences</li>
                                    <li>After installation, be sure to restart Firefox completely -
                                        all windows must be closed for the extension to install
                                        properly.</li>
                                    <li>When installation is successful and the client is installed,
                                        an option labelled &quot;CCR Client&quot; will

                                    <li>If your CCR Client Settings are utilizing a MedCommons CXP
                                        Server, a notification email can be sent to the TO Actors in
                                        the CCR when your CCR is processed. If you are using the
                                        barebones CXP public domain software, the contents of the
                                        CCR will be ignored. A supported MedCommons CXP server is
                                        preset in the CCR Client extension. You may change it at
                                        will, but note that Notification, Validation and Security
                                        features may not be supported by different CXP server
                                        implementations.</li>
                                    <li>Create or open a CCR in your EHR. CCR samples are in <a

                                    <li>If possible, enter a notification email address for
                                        MedCommons to use directly into your EHR software, otherwise
                                        you will have an opportunity to enter a notification address
                                        in Step 3.</li>
                                    <li>Save the file as myccr.xml (or another name if you like) on
                                        your local file system.</li>

                                    <li>Open FF if not already open, go to Tools>CCR Client (Fig 2,
                                        above) it will look similar to Fig. 1.</li>
                                    <li>Browse to the file myccr.xml wherever it is stored in local
                                        file system. Patient name, CCR Date and size information
                                        will be presented for validation. (Fig 3, top).</li>
                                    <li>Enter the email address of the party you would like
                                        MedCommons to Notify, and click Send. The CCR Client will
                                        add or change the email address of the TO Actor accordingly.
                                        You may change the Assigned PIN to one your destination user
                                        already knows and you can even add the PIN and a brief
                                        message to the Notification Subject box. If this was real
                                        patient data, you should not be so careless with the PIN and
                                        the system may issue a warning.</li>
                                    <li>When accepted, note that a Transaction ID and the PIN are
                                        added to your History list for future reference. (Fig 3,
