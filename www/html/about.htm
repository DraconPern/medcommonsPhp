                    <h3>ADRIAN GROPPER, M.D. - Chief Science Officer</h3>
                    <p class="p2">Adrian has pioneered the use of computers and the Internet to
                        deliver diagnostics to all physicians. For over 25 years, Adrian has used a
                        combination of engineering and medicine to transition sophisticated
                        diagnostics out of the specialist's lab and into everyday practice. Today,
                        he's at the forefront of making diagnostics accessible directly to patients
                        over the World Wide Web. </p>
                    <p class="p2">Adrian's career as a medical device developer began with
                        undergraduate education in mechanical engineering and computer simulation at
                        MIT, graduation from Harvard Medical School, and internship at the
                        University of Oregon Health Sciences Center. Adrian served as Director of
                        Biomedical Research at Orion Research, Inc, Adrian pioneered the field of
                        &quot;physician's office&quot; diagnostics with the first whole
                        blood analyzer designed for use outside of a laboratory setting. Adrian was
                        co-founder of Analytix, Inc. and developer of the first robotic blood
                        analyzer. </p>

                        General Hospital began in 1991 with early work on the Center for Innovative
                        Minimally Invasive Therapy, a joint project of the MGH departments of
                        radiology and surgery. As Chief Technology Officer of RSTAR, Inc,he ran
                        pioneering telemedicine projects throughout the world that spawned first

                        Systems (PACS). </p>
                    <p class="p2">In 1995, Adrian Gropper and Sean Doyle founded AMICAS(NYSE:AMCS)

                        FDA-clearance of its flagship product preceded the next Web-based image
                        management system by some 18 months. Today, AMICAS' Web-based PACS
                        technology is installed in over 400 facilities including such flagships as
                        MGH, Boston Medical Center, New York Presbyterian and Cornell Medical
                        Centers and The University of Chicago. </p>

                        ubiquitously available through use of standards and commodity
                        infrastructure. After graduating with an economics degree from MIT, Sean
                        developed econometric and statistical diagnostic algorithms at the MIT
                        Center for Computational Research, and at the Federal Reserve Board in
                        Washington, DC., and at the World Bank. Sean's imaging career started in
                        1989 when he joined the RSTAR project at Massachusetts General Hospital's
                        Department of Radiology. </p>

                        a structured measuring tool for an osteoporosis, deployed as part of the
                        first completely digital imaging and measurement clinical trial cleared by
                        the FDA. Returning to the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994, Sean
                        developed a visual Bayesian calculator for computing probabilities of
                        various genetic disorders constructed the initial prototypes for a
                        patient-centered life-long medical record. </p>
                    <p class="p2">In 1995 Adrian Gropper and Sean Doyle founded AMICAS . to deliver
                        clinical imaging applications built on web standards. Via judicious
                        combination of protocols and formats AMICAS was able to deliver images using
                        wavelets streaming over HTTP to the browsers on clinical desktops for fast,
                        ubiquitous access. </p>
