<h3>MedCommons Support for Trackers</h3>
<p>This note describes the implementation of Trackers within MedCommons. Trackers are implemented as a MedCommons Extension.
Code for Trackers is in /trunk/php/trackers
</p>
<h4>What is a Tracker?</h4>
<p>At this point, a Tracker is just a named object that maintains a timeseries history of values. It is associated with a MedCommons Account.
Each user, within his own account, accumulates an ever increasing collection of objects, representing weight, blood pressure,
glucose and blood test results, and more. A user adds each named Tracker to his account at his discretion, normally
utilizing the <a href=trackerEditor.php>Tracker Editor</a> and selecting from a dropdown list</p>
<p>Third parties can create libraries of additional trackers, either by simply building forms (either 
handmade or via <a href=/trackers/xform>xforms</a>) or by writing their own code (e.g. for data acquisition or display)
MedCommons can sell, rent, and bill for usages of these libraries. These third party libraries are also 
implemented as MedCommons Extensions </p>
<h4>Adding Tracker Support to Your MedCommons Account</h4>
Just get to the Extensions Page via:
<br>
<b>My Account > Apps and Services > Add Tracker Support </b>
<br>
<br>
You must add tracker support before you add any other Tracker Extension libraries from the Apps and Services Page
<h4>Using Trackers in Your Account </h4>
<p>You must be logged on to your account to use Trackers, unless you have hardwired the Tracker Gadget to your account.
You can <a href =viewTrackers.php>view</a> your Trackers anytime. </p><p>
Use the <a href=trackerEditor.php>editor</a> to choose and personalize your Trackers. You can set many properties of both the display system and the
means of data acquisiton.
<p>You can also utilize Trackers via your personal Google Homepage.</P> 
<h4>Defining New Trackers</h4>
There are two steps to making new trackers available on MedCommons.
<ul>
<li>Define a Catalog of your New Trackers </li>
<li>Wire the Catalog into the MedCommons Apps and Services Extension system </li>
</ul>
<p>The catalog is simply a list of trackers, their units, and some other simple properties. Here are some catalogs:
<a href=http://medcommons.net/apps/trackers/catalog-trackers-bcdmg.xml>blood catalog</a>,
<a href=http://medcommons.net/apps/trackers/catalog-trackers-gps.xml>gps catalog</a>, and finally the
<a href=http://medcommons.net/apps/trackers/catalog-trackers-builtin.xml>builtins</a> that get autoloaded when the Tracker Extension is installed.,
Note that these are just plain URLs, and might point to any website, not necessarily inside MedCommons</p>
<p>Wiring in Extensions to MedCommons is described <a href='../appsrv/index.html'>here</a> but we provide links to the 
<a href=http://medcommons.net/apps/trackers/svc-trackers-bcdmg-package.xml>blood extension</a> and
<a href=http://medcommons.net/apps/trackers/svc-trackers-gps-package.xml>gps extension</a>. There is no 
extension for the builtins. <i>You need to make sure the 'id' field' in both the Catalog xml file and the Extension xml file are
identical</i>
</p>
<h4>Add Your Own Code to the Tracker System</h4>
You can extend the Tracker System in various ways:
<ul>
<li>You can plug in your own xForms compatible remote input source to deliver Tracker Messages into your account</li>
<li>You can write your own Graphics code that runs inside the user's Account</li>
<li>You can write a custom viewer in PHP or Java that completely replaces the builtin tracker display</li>
<li>You can write a background program that transparently updates the users Trackers as needed</li>
</ul>
It's a little vague right now on how to do this on a personal level, but all of the callbacks are in place in both the 
catalogs and extension xml files. You can just edit these xml files to play with this for now.
<h4>Adding 3rd Party Code to the Trackers</h4>
Most users will not add their own code, but rather buy or rent code from 3rd parties. MedCommons acts as a broker in this
situation, taking a service fee for providing access to the account and for billing.
