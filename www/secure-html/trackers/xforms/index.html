<h3>Xform Support for Trackers</h3>
<p>This note details progress towards the implementation of Xforms within MedCommons Trackers.
</p>
<h4>The Tracker Input Message Format is an XForms 'Instance'</h4>
<p>Because MedCommons is so keen on standards, and there really isn't any standard, we can
use XML and Xforms to define a Message Format for Trackers. This will allow any forms system, PDA, or 
lab system that utilizes Xforms to send Tracker messages into a MedCommons account</p>
<p>Here is a sample Tracker Message: 
<br /><a href="<A HREF="38292038291938392-10305066999-trackermsg.xml">38292038291938392-10305066999-trackermsg.xml</A>
Here is another:
<br /><a href="<A HREF="38292038291938392-1030506434-trackermsg.xml">38292038291938392-10305066434-trackermsg.xml</A>
</p>
<p>You can send either of these files to the Tracker Xforms handler at 
/trackers/xform/handleTrackerMsg.php?file=</p><br />
<a href=handleTrackerMsg.php?file=38292038291938392-10305066434-trackermsg.xml>Try it</a>
<h4>A schema for Tracker Messages</h4>
<p>This is used by the Model part of Xforms
<A HREF="trackerschema.xsd">trackerschema.xsd</A>
&nbsp; But, because xForms is working poorly in both Firefox and IE7 right now, it is not possible to demonstrate
without third party flash plugins. I am confident we will find the right library to make all of this happen</p>
<h4>Using the Xform Model</h4>
<p>The basic file format for Trackers is laid out here in<A HREF="tracker.html">tracker.html</A> 
It is what drives xform processing. Note that the 'instance' part is kept in another file over <A HREF="agropper-bloodpressure-tracker-setup.xml">here</A> It's been especially tailored for Adrian</p>
<h4>What's next?</h4>
So far, we have shown that Trackers can be driven by Xforms, if only we somehow get Xforms to work as we need it to.
Here are some more things to do
<ul>
<li>find browsers and javascript that actually work decently with xforms</li>
<li>find tools that adrian likes to build these xforms</li>
<li>with selected tools, allow 3rd parties to customize trackers without programming</li>
<li>move xForms into other, more complicated parts of MedCommons</li>
