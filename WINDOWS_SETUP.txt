A very terse description of setup on windows:

1. install java
2. install cygwin (inc. svn)
2.1 checkout /services/trunk/php
3. install xampp
4. adjust php.ini,  httpd.conf
  4.1 If using xampp 1.7, follow instructions here:  http://www.apachefriends.org/f/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=32617
5. install python 2.5 (NOT 2.6)
7. install python mysql support 
   - download exe installer for mysql-python from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
8. install fpconst from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/fpconst/fpconst-0.7.2.tar.gz#md5=10ba9e04129af23108d24c22c3a698b1
   use 'python setup.py install' to install
9. install SOAPpy from http://transact.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pywebsvcs/SOAPpy-0.11.1.tar.gz
   NOTE: get .11.x, don't get .12, it's broken in python 2.5
   use 'python setup.py install' to install
10. Set $GLOBALS['Script_Domain'] = null in urls.inc.php - necessary because by default it's set to your domain, 
    but script domain can't have less than two components to work in javascript.  So if your machine
    is not referenced by fully qualified domain name (eg: localhost, 'foo') it won't work.
