Alerts are generated by alerter.php. This http GETs .../console/media/img/greenball.png from registered systems which,
if successful, it takes to be healthy. Alert notifications are distributed to email addresses registered in
the database alertinfo.notifiers. Notifications are logged in the database alertinfo.alertlog. Two shell scripts allow
running it as a service on designated monitor systems: mc_alerter provide init start/stop/restart/status control;
mc_launch_alerter launches alerter.php, directing its output to a log file and registering it's pid.

Alerter.php can/should be run as a service by:

	- Creating the alertinfo database
	- Deploying alerter.php and mc_launch_alerter to /var/www/html/notifications
	- Deploying mc_alerter to /etc/init.d and...
	- Running: chkconfig -add mc_alerter

The alert generator can be run in a browser: http://<server>/notifications/alerter.php?refresh=NNN. The whole kit can
be run from any server (preferably/obviously not one that's being monitored); Dump, copy and reload the database when
moving it. Save and alertlog.notifiers table when changes are made (notifers.sql in this directory). 

If and when the number of servers gets too large to manage with one monitoring system, divide alertlog.notifiers into
a number of partitions and setup a number of instances of this on a number of servers. An instance of this can/should
be setup to monitor the monitors.

Fyi, the IGA status page does the same green ball png checking against a seperate (csv file) database (.../iga/machines.csv)
which should also be updated if/when the network configuration changes.
