<h3>Worklist</h3>
<p>The Worklist is command central for you or your group. For patients, it tracks changes to their Personal Health Record (PHR). For caregivers, it shows patient activity. When you log in, MedCommons takes you to your Worklist.
</p><p>
The members of a Group share a Worklist. This helps caregivers to communicate and cover for each other. The Worklist complements email Notifications to ensure that important events don't "fall through the cracks".
</p><p>
To see the Worklist in action, edit and send yourself the Demo CCR?. You will receive an email Notification and the Worklist will be updated as well. Your Notification will remain valid for a few days but, because this is a public web site, your changes this Worklist will not persist as they would with a real account.
