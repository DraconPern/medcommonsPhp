<div id="dty-0" class="c3">Universally accessible using Adobe Acrobat and many other applications, the PDF format is the dominant means of capturing complete, legally binding medical records requests that include narrative diagnostic reports, clinical notes, surgical and procedure summaries as well as nursing notes. Complete medical records are essential for second opinions and for protection from medical errors. PDF documents can be added to a HealthURL account by direct upload from any browser or they can be automatically converted from paper using personalized coded fax cover sheets.<br id="byx60">
