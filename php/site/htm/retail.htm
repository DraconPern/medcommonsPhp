<h2><b> HealthURL Account Description</b></h2>
<p>A MedCommons HealthURL Account is a standards-based, private medical records archive on the Web. The HealthURL is created by a health care provider on the patient's behalf or by the patient herself and control of the account can pass from the health care provider to the patient at any time. The HealthURL typically contains authoritative information from doctors, imaging centers and labs but it is also patient-controlled - the patient can decide what information to keep and how the information is to be shared.</p>

<p>A HealthURL subscription includes records management and storage and access to a downloadable medical records editor (Windows XP and Vista only). Accounts also provide an automatic way to turn paper records and reports into standard PDF documents by simply faxing them into a toll-free number and to manage and display full quality radiology scans. Fax-in and radiology uploads are an extra-cost option. Authorized users, including the patient, of course, are able to view account contents conveniently over the Web and from high performance mobile devices such as the iPhone.</p>

<p>HealthURL accounts feature innovative privacy and convenience technologies that enable single sign-on for both patients and doctors. Authorized doctors, patients and others can sign-in directly using the OpenID standard. In addition, patients, their family and friends can access the HealthURL and communicate with each other using the <a target='_new' href='http://apps.facebook.com/medcommons' >MedCommons Application</a>on Facebook. The medical information itself is not transmitted to Facebook and the patient can connect or disconnect the access via Facebook at any time.</p>

<p>Your private health information will be stored in a HealthURL account hosted by <a href='https://healthurl.medcommons.net/'>medcommons.net</a> and using Amazon Web Services. MedCommons HealthURL accounts are a subscription ($2/month) plus a hosting fee. The hosting fee for a typical account without radiology images and 100 pages of documents might be a penny ($0.01) per month. All payments are made through Amazon Payment Services and will require either a credit card or a corporate account on file with Amazon. MedCommons does not see or store your payment information. Account charges can be reviewed and accounts canceled at any time directly from your <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp-applications' >Application Billing Page</a> at Amazon.

<h2>
What Distinguishes MedCommons?</h2>
<p><ul><li>our mission is to redefine high value legacy, enterprise-centric, healthcare applications and workflows (such as radiology/PACS and records management) to function as distributed, cross-enterprise, virtual networks running on low-cost, commodity infrastructure </li>
<li>our platform integrates the social-networking features of web2.0 services like Facebook and Google, offering disease management groups, care teams, and medical homes, and all interested parties a place to operate</li>
<li>we will offer standards based interoperability with the forthcoming consumer health offerings from <li><a href=healthvault.php title='integrating healthvault and medcommons' >Microsoft  Healthvault</a>, Dossia (WalMart, Intel and more...) and Google Health, bridging these and other disparate services</li>
<li>we offer a system for long term storage and retrieval of fully standards-based, interoperable patient records that can be operated by the smallest single provider office, the largest hospital network, employer, or healthcare storage provider, and can be configured with or without patient control</li>
<li>we offer patient control of her identity, privacy, her personal medical records, and a means to grant consent to others, and to receive notifications about account status; we allow accounts formed by doctors for their own purposes to be transferred to patient control if they choose</li>
<li>we run everything over the Internet,  including hosted data centers (at the customer&quot;s preferred site or Amazon EC2), backup storage (onsite or Amazon S3)</li>
<li>we have bundled all of these capabilities into a shrink-wrapped Appliance, which will be sold as an intelligent router with many customer selectable options</li>
<li>our business model is to license appliances and share revenue for  transactions vended by the licensee, and separately benefit from advertising revenue from the social networking interfaces.</li> </ul></p>
<h2>
Benefits to Patients</h2>
<p>
The focus of healthcare is shifting to the consumer at an accelerating pace. MedCommons believes that widespread distribution of standards based healthcare solutions is inevitable and we are committed to delivering low cost, customizable solutions for small practices and large healthcare networks in support of next generation applications: a telemedicine consultation can be arranged in seconds, a retail clinic can communicate instantly with a patient&quot;s own doctor and with other providers, an imaging center can reduce costs and improve its relationship with referring physicians and their patients, and disease management protocols can be driven by an up to date view of the patient&quot;s record. </p></div>
