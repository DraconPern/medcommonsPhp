Amazon Storage and Payments</a></h3><div class="closed" id="ypapd" style="display:none;" >

Fax In Documents</a></h3><div class="closed" id="zpapd" style="display:none;" >

Paper is convenient but difficult to organize and share. MedCommons coded Fax cover sheets enable patient and doctor alike to send paper directly to any HealthURL where it appears in the familiar PDF format ready to be printed, archived and shared. Direct fax cover sheets and a toll-free number are convenient and cost-effective because you pay only if you use the Fax In service.

Facebook Private Care Teams</a></h3><div class="closed" id="ypapc" style="display:none;" >
Parents, adult children, health coaches and independent specialists are often members of today's care team. For maximum convenience and flexibility, assemble your private care team around the powerful technology of Facebook. Invited care team members will enjoy direct "single sign-on" into the patient's HealthURL while keeping private information separate and outside of Facebook.

Diagnostic Imaging and more</a></h3><div class="closed" id="zpapc" style="display:none;" >

MedCommons imaging is FDA-registered for use by doctors. Professional features include a downloadable DICOM network client and a plug-in to the powerful OsiriX 3D workstation. Client, plugin and workstation are free and open source.
