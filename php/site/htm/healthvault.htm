<h2>Ready for HealthVault</h2>
HealthVault and MedCommons will play well together:
<ul>
<li>MedCommons and HealthVault are built upon common standards</li>
<li>MedCommons will support two way transfers in and out of personal Windows Live HealthVault Accounts</li>
<li>MedCommons also integrates Facebook, and the forthcoming Google Social Network, as well as the Windows Live HealthVault Service</li>

<li>MedCommons sells shrink-wrapped HealURL Appliances as both hardware and vmware/linux software appliances;  incrementally add more appliances as volume grows</li>
<li>Appliance is controlled via a router-Like console interface; Owner controls the brand seen by users</li>
<li>Appliance stores patient HealthURL Accounts on premises, offsite, or both</li>
<li>Optionally operate an OpenID Identity Provider to issue Single Sign-On Identities; and selectively reflect trust relationships with other service providers</li>
<li>Selectively participate in other Social Networks such as Facebook; or build your own web2.0 network using our RestFull web services API/li>
<li>Provide a customizable portal for Patients, and a separate one for Providers</li>

            MedCommons HealthURL Appliance</h1>
        <p>
            A Health URL is a patient-centered portfolio of private health information on the
            Internet. Each Health URL points to an individual person's account that stores and
            delivers health records assembled from hospitals and other health care providers,
            important documents such as advance directives and diagnostic imaging such as CT
            and MRI studies. Health URL accounts are used collaboratively by physicians and
            other clinical practitioners as well as by interested patients and their authorized
            caregivers. Access to the Health URL account is via over 30 standard Web services
            and legacy enterprise interfaces. Strict, HIPAA-compliant privacy and security safeguards
            are integral to the Appliance. A hospital, practice or service provider hosts Health
            URL accounts on behalf of their patients by licensing software for installation
            on-site or in a hosting center. The MedCommons Health URL Appliance is a convenient,
            integrated and HIPAA-compliant way for a provider to add Internet collaboration for
            telemedicine, referrals, secure messaging, paperless health information management,
            night call coverage, home care devices, interaction with retail clinics as well
            as new consumer-centered Web sites. A RESTful API is ready for Web 2.0 integration
            in health care.
