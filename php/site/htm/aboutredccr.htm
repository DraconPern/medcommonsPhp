		<h1>About Emergency CCRs</h1>
<p>An Emergency CCR is a snapshot of a patient's health profile that is set up and maintained by a patient or her designated relative or guardian.</p>

<p>By establishing an Emergency CCR with MedCommons you are enabling immediate access to your relevant personal healthcare information from anywhere on the Internet. Once setup, you can print a wallet-size patient card to carry in your wallet, use a key FOB or wear bracelet that identifies you and your account on MedCommons. A healthcare provider can take your ID, go to the MedCommons homepage at <a href="http://www.medcommons.net">www.medcommons.net</a> and quickly view your critical medical information on your Emergency CCR.</p>
<h4>Setting up Your Emergency CCR</h4>
<p>First you need to create a MedCommons Account, either through your PHR or directly on MedCommons. 
</p>
<p>To do this on MedCommons go to the MedCommons homepage, click on Register, enter your details, and then logon to MedCommons.
</p>

<p>Now go back to the MedCommons homepage and click on the Create CCR link .Enter as much information as you like on this form, and hit Save. Go to the little yellow post-it sticky and click on 'Set as Emergency CCR'. You can also print a wallet card from the same sticky menu.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if your PHR vendor supports the CCR standard, you can export your CCR directly from your PHR application to your MedCommons account. Either way, once set up, you and your providers have universal access to this particular CCR and the critical medical information it contains.</p>
<h4>Accessing the Emergency CCR</h4>
<p>To access the Emergency CCR, go to the MedCommons homepage, click on the red Emergency CCR link, and then enter the 16 digit account number from the back of your wallet card. That's it. MedCommons will send you an email to the address you supplied on registration whenever your CCR is accessed.
