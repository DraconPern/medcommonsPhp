		<h3>How does a Health URL fit with my Web site and EHR? </h3>
		<p>Like your Web site server, the Health URL 
		Appliance is located outside the firewall of your institution (sometimes 
		called the DMZ). Also like a Web site, the Health URL server can be 
		physically located in the computer room or hosted by a service provider. 
		Whether locally installed or hosted, the institution that licenses the 
		Health URL Appliance is in full control of policies, branding and 
		private health information on the Health URL Appliance. </p>
		<p>Your EHR, databases and other practice management systems are 
		typically located on the local area network (LAN) inside the firewall of 
		your institution. The Health URL Appliance uses standard document 
		formats and standard Web service protocols to communicate with the EHR, 
		clinical data repository, PACS, Web browsers and other software 
		applications that are secured behind your firewall. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-02">
		<h3>Is the MedCommons Health URL a PHR 
			(personal health record)? </h3>
		<p>No. As implemented by MedCommons, the Health 
			URL is an authoritative, EHR-quality archive made accessible through 
			Web interfaces. Because we handle diagnostic imaging, the MedCommons 
			Health URL Appliance is FDA registered as a medical device. Both 
			PHRs and EHRs can connect to a Health URL. </p>
		<p>Physicians are reluctant to use a health record that may have 
			been modified by the patient. To reduce this objection, MedCommons 
			uses the ASTM-standard Continuity of Care Record (CCR) as the native 
			data model because of its ability to assign attribution and manage 
			digital signatures for each and every component of the health 
			record. Individual lab results, vaccinations, radiology reports, 
			etc... retain their chain of custody even in cases where different 
			practices and the patient himself are actively collaborating around 
			a Health URL. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-03">
		<h3>My EMR has a patient portal feature, why 
			would I install a HealthURL appliance? </h3>
		<p>Scalability. Patient portals are difficult to 
			use by clinicians outside of your organization which limits your 
			ability to offer clinical and disease management services in a home 
			or community setting. A Health URL reduces the risk of collaboration 
			with each patient's extended care team by serving as an "airlock" 
			for clinical information passing in and out of your internal 
			systems. Your clinicians have an opportunity to review information 
			and import selectively into the EMR. The Appliance's Group 
			Worklists, Consent, Authorization and patient-accessible Activity 
			Log features are designed to complement your routine workflows even 
			as you extend patient-centered collaboration in your practice. 
			Because it is based on a CCR-standard patient model, the Health URL 
			account can markedly reduce interface and integration costs in large 
			institutions, regional and national-scale systems that must 
			accommodate diverse health IT systems. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-04">
		<h3>Do all MedCommons Health URLs look alike?
			</h3>
		<p>No. The Health URL Appliance provides separate 
			components and numerous standard interfaces that facilitate branding 
			and integration into patient portals, PHR, telemedicine and EHR 
			systems. Login, workflow and privacy components are separate and can 
			be modified and embedded as needed. Emails, printouts, cell phone 
			SMS messages and fax cover sheets are customized from provided 
			templates. Web services interfaces are provided for creating new 
			accounts and moving documents and images in and out including DICOM 
			images and HIPAA authorization documents. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-05">
		<h3>Who controls a MedCommons Health URL? </h3>
		<p>It depends. Access to an Account is managed by 
			the Appliance on the basis of account policies known as consents. Separate 
			policies are established at the Appliance, User Group and Account 
			levels. Each Account is encrypted separately. As the Appliance 
			receives requests for information it utilizes the Consent Mechanisms
			 to combine applicable policies into an access control 
			decision. By default, Accounts are under the control of the Group 
			that initially created the Account. In short-term, telemedicine 
			consultations the patient may never realize that they have a Health 
			URL Account. In some cases, the patient will take control of their 
			Health URL or transfer control to a family member by changing the 
			Account-level policy document. In cases where an Account is moved 
			from one Appliance to another, the applicable consents and 
			authorization documents will be transferred along with the CCR, 
			DICOM and PDF documents. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-06">
		<h3>How is information entered into the Health 
			URL? </h3>
		<p>Information flows in through compatible 
			documents and forms. The MedCommons Health URL automatically 
			assembles the information into a Current CCR, ready for export or 
			on-line review. PDF documents, DICOM imaging studies and JPEG images 
			become references in the CCR. Original source documents, including 
			imaging, are archived and available whether or not they are kept as 
			part of the Current CCR. Documents can be faxed directly into an 
			account using custom bar-coded cover sheets. A range of forms is 
			available for direct on-line entry of information including patient 
			consent and release authorizations. Forms creation and scripting 
			tools enable rapid development of custom forms supported by built-in 
			CCR standard encoding and validation tests. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-07">
		<h3>How does information leave the Health URL?
			</h3>
		<p>Information is retrieved from the Health URL 
			Account as original documents and live collaboration documents such 
			as the Current CCR. A complete backup of all documents is accessible 
			with a single click. Information related to Account activity is sent 
			out by email, SMS message and RSS feed. </p></div>
	<div id="faq-08">
		<h3>Why do you license the MedCommons Health 
			URL as an appliance? </h3>
		<p>Security. An appliance is designed and 
			optimized for a particular purpose. The HealthURL Appliance is 
			designed to reduce privacy and security risks as health care 
			practices connect to the Internet. The major components of the 
			appliance (color in Fig 2 at right) have been selected to reduce 
			both cost and risk by making it easy document support for HIPAA and 
			state regulations. The use of standard and public-domain protocols 
			to access the appliance (arrows in Fig 2) increases security and 
			promotes innovation in both health IT and Web services. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="faq-09">
		<h3>How are Health URL Accounts secured? </h3>
		<p>Access to Health URL Accounts is controlled 
			directly, through interfaces to an enterprise directory and under 
			standards-based federated identity services. Direct access is 
			granted to authorized users that have registrations on the Health 
			URL Appliance itself. Larger installations can interface the 
			Appliance to their LDAP-compatible directory. For the largest 
			regional and national-scale networks, Health URL Appliances support 
			federated identity protocols. </p></div>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;MedCommons HealthURL Account&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Use a MedCommons Account to collect your medical records routinely
<span id=ccda0><i id=m_nt0>before</i></span> you need them. You and your family
supports will be able to review these records for safety, second opinions, care
coordination and more convenient care. Create your care team in Facebook or
independently and invite anyone, anywhere to access the information they need.
