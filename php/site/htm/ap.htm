				<h1>Applications</h1></div>
			<h3>Telemedicine </h3>
			<p>A telemedicine consultation anywhere in the 
			world, can be arranged in seconds over MedCommons. A HealthURL 
			account is created for the patient and shared by the practitioners. 
			The account can be temporary or can persist for follow-up. </p>
			<p>The use of a Health URL for telemedicine offers significant 
			benefits over typical point-to-point connections. Secure, Web 
			browser access is easier than VPN connections and accessible behind 
			firewalls and even over low-grade connections in the developing 
			world. The Health URL approach enables a practically unlimited 
			number of participants for team consultation and medical education. 
			Participants can be pre-registered or invited ad-hoc using a PIN. 
			Pre-registered participants can be notified of telemedicine activity 
			through a group worklist or the corresponding RSS feed. </p>
			<p>Health URL accounts allow the import of a JPEG images from a 
			digital camera, scanned documents or DICOM images. Users who need to 
			store images and documents locally because of low speed or 
			intermittent Internet connections can do so. The sophisticated open 
			source OsiriX workstation is freely available and integrated with 
			the Health URL for use with locally cached images and by 
			radiologists, cardiologists and surgeons who need sophisticated 
			measurement, 3D and image fusion tools. </p>
			<p>Telemedicine consultations are typically covered under HIPAA 
			treatment consent and thus do not require separate authorization by 
			the patient. Temporary HealthURL accounts can be deleted, converted 
			to archival HealthURL accounts or allowed to expire. Regardless, 
			Health URL accounts include the HIPAA-mandated Activity Log. </p>

			<h3>HIPAA Records Requests </h3>
			<p>All practices are required to process 
				medical records requests from patients and authorized 
				caregivers. By using a HealthURL instead of paper, the Health 
				Information Management (HIM) department of a hospital or any 
				practice can formalize and document their records release 
				process while reducing labor and paper-handling costs. </p>
			<p>The MedCommons Health URL Appliance enables users to 
				customize the records request form templates as needed. The 
				resulting form can be printed and filled out on a clipboard in 
				the traditional way or it can be filled out on-line with any Web 
				browser. Caregivers can print the request form associated with a 
				Health URL on-demand. Remote authorization options are available 
				when requesting practices have acceptable MedCommons 
				credentials, a satisfactory Fax connection or can respond to a 
				PIN challenge that has been authorized by the patient. </p>
			<p>Instead of printing paper, records can be printed directly to 
				PDF and attached to the patient's Health URL. Paper records can 
				be scanned directly into the Health URL using a bar-coded fax 
				cover sheet specific to the Health URL account. Instead of 
				burning CDs, the radiology film library can send DICOM directly 
				to the Health URL using free MedCommons DDL utility. </p>
			<p>Some hospitals can save labor and materials costs while 
				improving customer service by merging film library and HIM 
				operations around a Health URL appliance. </p>
			<p>Film libraries and most HIM departments charge for processing 
				records requests. The MedCommons Health URL appliance allows the 
				practice to charge the requester's credit card. </p>
			<p>Most important, patient care, patients and referring 
				clinicians will be better served by faster processing and 
				integration of imaging, reports, authorizations into a standard 
				format suitable for Web access, download or automated processing 
				by standards-based EHRs. </p></div>

			<h3>Outcomes Registry </h3>
			<p>National and international public health, 
				biosurveillance, post-market drug and device follow-up and 
				pay-for-performance programs require updating of 'outcomes 
				registries' after clinical encounters. A MedCommons Health URL 
				supports both the privacy and information aggregation needs of 
				outcomes registries using non-proprietary, open standards 
				throughout. </p>
			<p>SAML 2.0 certificates and federated identity options combine 
				with the Health URL's access authorization and Account Activity 
				Log mechanisms to support any combination of registries 
				including legally mandated, IRB-approved and patient authorized 
				systems. </p>
			<p>The CCR-native information model of MedCommons Health URLs 
				benefits integration and operation of outcomes registries. As 
				clinical encounters generate CCR documents and export them to 
				the patient's Health URL, configurable routines merge the CCR 
				objects into a separate SQL database that corresponds to each 
				patient's information model. The MedCommons Current CCR is a 
				live document derived from the account database on-demand 
				anytime the Health URL is accessed. </p>
			<p>Registries can subscribe to RSS feeds or accept 
				email-notifications of Health URL merge activity. If authorized, 
				the registry can access some or all of the Current CCR or the 
				entire account. </p>
			<p>The ASTM-CCR is designed to make anonymization relatively 
				easy. Although not included in the initial release of the 
				MedCommons Health URL appliance, anonymization features can be 
				supported as custom integration project with interested 
				licensees. </p></div>
		<div id="apps-04">
			<h3>Retail Clinics </h3>
			<p>Retail clinics in stores, pharmacies and 
				workplaces depend on good communications with physicians to 
				offer continuity of care. Adding Health URL support to their 
				information system allows the clinic to reduce costs, improve 
				client loyalty and become better integrated with local primary 
				care and hospital practices. </p>
			<p>The Health URL is superior to a paper printout because it 
				will not be lost, can be updated as laboratory results come in 
				and can trigger emails to the patient as well as the patient's 
				designated caregivers. </p>
			<p>The Health URL can be provided by either the retail clinic or 
				the patient's designated practice provides a good way to 
				communicate results while keeping the patient "in the loop". By 
				analogy with phone number portability or ATM networks, 
				MedCommons will route Health URL transactions to the MedCommons 
				licensee hosting that particular account. Licensees can brand, 
				control policy and customize the functionality exposed by their 
				Health URL appliance to differentiate their services. </p>
			<p>MedCommons, in the role of routing service, does not need to 
				access private health information and does not add HIPAA risk 
				and cost to either the retail clinic or physician's practice.
				</p>
			<p>In cases where health care organizations and primary care 
				practices choose to operate or supervise retail and 
				employer-based clinics, installation of a MedCommons Health URL 
				appliance can provide a simple and cost-effective means to 
				extend their clinical network throughout a region. MedCommons 
				credit card processing can be optionally integrated into the 
				account forms. </p>
			<p>On the other end of the spectrum, national-scale retail 
				services can benefit from MedCommons support for scalable, 
				standards-based federated identity management and single sign-on 
				mechanisms that cross state jurisdictions and reach beyond 
				health care to government, insurance, telecommunications and 
				banking services. </p></div>

			<h3>Radiology Services </h3>
			<p>Imaging centers, after hours coverage, 3D 
				processing labs, sports medicine and sub-specialty 
				interpretation practices depend on broad reach and service 
				excellence to drive referrals. MedCommons Health URLs provide 
				Web browser convenience, DICOM and PACS integration and 
				integrated on-line order capture without proprietary hardware or 
				costly virtual private networks (VPN). </p>
			<p>As a foundation for your radiology services network, 
				MedCommons Health URLs are standards-based for better 
				integration and lower costs than proprietary network solutions.
				</p>
			<p>Continuity of Care Record (CCR) integration provides clinical 
				context to both orders and reports. Diverse notification options 
				including email, cell phones, and shared on-line access help are 
				a key service to your referring physicians. </p>
			<p>Although many will opt for the speed and convenience of 
				on-demand Web browser access, surgeons and other image-dependent 
				specialists benefit from integration of the Health URL their 
				existing DICOM workstation or the freely available with the 
				sophisticated open source OsiriX workstations. </p>
			<p>OsiriX is a full-featured diagnostic workstation available as 
				free software for the Macintosh. Although OsiriX can use the 
				MedCommons DDL utility via DICOM, MedCommons provides a higher 
				level of integration with a plug-in optimized for OsiriX. The 
				plugin automatically launches OsiriX to view DICOM references in 
				a MedCommons CCR and it automatically opens a new Report CCR 
				with DICOM references already attached. </p>
			<p>The MedComons Health URL appliance makes it easy and safe to 
				bring DICOM CDs into small practices and large hospitals alike. 
				Free downloadable utilities process the CD and send the DICOM to 
				the appliance in one step. An inexpensive, dedicated PC can be 
				used to avoid the risk of infection by unknown software. Users 
				throughout your organization can then view the DICOM without in 
				their Web browser and using a consistent and familiar user 
				interface regardless of the source vendor. If desired, users 
				with PACS or diagnostic workstations can import the DICOM via 
				the Health URL without any risk of infection from foreign media.

			<h3>Home Care </h3>
			<p>New devices, professional services and 
				family supports can collaborate to provide safe and effective 
				care in the home. A patient's Health URL provides a single point 
				of contact for the collaborators. Standards-based devices with 
				Internet access will connect directly and securely into the 
				Health URL using standard protocols. </p>
			<p>Please contact MedCommons for a demonstration of secure 
				Health URL access from cell phones. </p>
			<p>Direct input by patients and unaffiliated providers is not 
				practical in today's EHR systems for both workflow and security 
				reasons. For now, the the EHR user's Web browser can access the 
				patient's Health URL directly. </p></div>
		<div id="apps-07">
			<h3>Disease Management </h3>
			<p>Disease management protocols are driven 
				from an up-to-date view of the patient's record. The patient's 
				Health URL aggregates information from primary care, 
				specialists, consultants, retail clinics and family supports and 
				organizes it into a standard XML document accessible as the 
				Current CCR with separate attribution for each data source. 
				Authorized disease management services can access either the 
				Current CCR or search through all of the documents in the Health 
				URL account. Protocol output in CCR format can update the 
				patient's Current CCR directly or as a PDF document. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="apps-08">
			<h3>Sports Medicine </h3>
			<p>Sports injuries often happen on the road. A 
				Health URL for team members can help to speed diagnosis and 
				support decisions by bringing together resources familiar with 
				the patient, resources available on site and specialist 
				consultants wherever they might be. MedCommons Health URLs 
				provide the ability to capture and communicate diagnostic 
				imaging within minutes directly from CT or MR scanners and 
				digital X-ray equipment. The MedCommons administrator's console 
				manages email, cell phone, fax, group and PIN assignments to 
				enable ad-hoc collaboration without delay. </p></div>
		<div id="apps-09">
			<h3>Tertiary Care Referrals </h3>
			<p>Transplants, cancer therapy and major 
				surgery can be delayed while necessary images, documents, 
				reports and laboratory results are gathered from primary care, 
				local hospitals and imaging facilities. A Health URL is 
				accessible directly by all information sources. Patient 
				authorization forms can be managed as documents in the Health 
				URL directly or via fax. </p></div>
		<div id="apps-10">
			<h3>Social Networks </h3>
			<p>Chronically ill patients, medical residents 
				and lifelong students increasingly come together in Internet 
				forums. Example cases and anonymized health records are a 
				valuable addition to these forums.     <div  style='float: left;  vertical-align: top; padding: 3px; border: dashed 1px;'><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get A Personal Account&nbsp;</h2>
